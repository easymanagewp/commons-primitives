<section name="Commons Primitives">
<p>
The Java language is mostly Object based, however the original designers chose
to include eight primitive types - boolean, byte, char, double, float, int, long and short.
Commons Primitives provides a library of collections and utilities specially
designed for use with primitive types.
</p>
<p>
JDK 1.5 added auto-boxing to simplify working with primitive types.
This is simply a mechanism of automatically converting a primitive to an Object
and vice versa, an operation with potentially large memory and performance issues.
Commons Primitives offers collections that hold the primitive type directly, and
as a result they are usually smaller, faster and easier to work with than
their purely Object based alternatives.
