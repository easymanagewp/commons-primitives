<section name="The Primitives Component">
<p>
The Java language has a fundamental distinction between primitive and object types.
The JDK provides many methods and utilities that work with objects, including the widely used
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/guide/collections/">Collections API</a>.
There are relatively few classes for working with primitive types however.
</p>
<p>
The <i>primitives</i> component fills the gaps left by the JDK.
Specialised implementations of Collections and Lists for primitive types are provided.
Further development aims to produce Maps and other utility code.
</p>
</section>

<section name="Status">
<p>
The primitives component starts with a stable implementation of primitive Collection and List
classes previously unreleased in the collections component. These classes will be released
in the near future.
</p>
<p>
There is plenty of scope for new additions to primitives. So, if you feel like voluntering
please contact the commons-dev mailing list and prefix emails by [primitives].
